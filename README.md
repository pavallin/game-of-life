# game-of-life
My take on Conway's Game Of Life in Javascript/HTML/CSS. The whole thing was done in a few hours, when I was in the process of learning JavaScript and DOM modifying.

The website is explained in french.

One interesting feature is the encoding of the grid in decimal strings (seeds). This reduces the number of characters needed, compared to a sequence of 0s and 1s.
This could even be optimized by using hexadecimal or ASCII characters; to be continued :)

TODO: add a randomize feature, with a probability slider.
TODO: add colors and alternate sets of rules.
